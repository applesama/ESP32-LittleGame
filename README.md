# ESP32-LittleGame
Just a little game that was created by me and the other one of my classmate

Here are the instruction of this game: 
This is simple game that the you use right and left button to move your figher right or left to avoid enemy's firepower and shoot the enemy. 
There are two kinds of enemies in this game, one is normal enemy, it drives a small figher and only has one HP which can be killed by one shot, 
the other one is the boss, it drives a larger ship and has 5 HP at the start, but every time the next boss will always increase 5 HP, which means the boss will get harder and harder to kill. Shoot and hit the enemy can get score, 
even you does not kill it (e.g. boss can't be killed by one shot) 

Every time when you kill the enemy, you will upgrade for one level, whatever the boss or normal enemy. 
The top level is 9, as you get higher and higher level, your firepower(bullet amout, bullet speed) will be enhanced in different level,
the enemy will also be enhanced(Both it's firepower and moving speed). 

Each game the player will get 3 HP, 
every time the player get shot will lose one HP, when HP reduce to zero, game over, but if the player kill the boss, 
it will get three fifh of the boss's default HP, e.g. if the boss has 15 HP and you can get 3 HP by kill the boss. 

Boss has stronger fire power than the normal enemy.
